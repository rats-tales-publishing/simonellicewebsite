I turned to go, ignoring the hurt I was causing. It was just a small reflection of the hurt I was feeling.


I looked in at the other watch stations briefly, just to see all
 was well but not to get into conversation, and went to the comms shack.
 Signaller Hardcastle was at the set, big olive headphones obscuring 
much of his head. He nodded to me and went back to concentrating. I 
checked the screen showing the thermal image sensors that looked out 
into the night; nothing warm-blooded was moving on the hills, and pulled
 up a chair. The temperature was dropping and I wished I’d thought to go
 and get myself some hot chocolate before I came in.


An hour later I rectified that after I’d walked round again and 
got some for Hardcastle too. There was a light on in the OC’s tent. He 
never seemed to sleep, poor sod; carrying the whole thing on his back. 
Two hours after that Gerald tapped me on the shoulder and I went off to 
our tent.


I took off my body armour, helmet and boots and lay under my 
sleeping bag on my cot staring at the canvas. I wanted to sleep but I 
kept thinking about Avus and then trying not to think about him and all 
the things we would no longer be able to do together. I got the old pipe
 of his that I’d lifted from the desk in his study out of my pocket and 
sniffed it and rubbed the polished wooden bowl with my fingers. Ironic 
that it was his and precious to me, and that it had almost certainly 
helped to take him from me.


An hour later I’d moved on to thinking about C section and some 
of the others and wishing I didn’t have to leave them. And to wishing 
I’d thought to have a piss before lying down. I didn’t bother to put my 
boots on but just walked through the tents to use the side of the 
barriers as many did. A light cloud covering had obscured the stars and 
it was bloody dark so I went by touch as much as by sight.


I was standing there smelling the warm pungent smell rising from
 the stream of liquid hitting the wall and listening to the distant beat
 of the music that was still coming from the village when I heard a 
sound that was something between a grunt and a sigh and then a low, 
persistent scuffling. I zipped myself up and went in search of its 
source, treading silently on the packed dirt.


It was really black dark back there and I don’t think I was 
fully awake. I caught my foot on one of the sandbags holding down the 
bottom of a tent and then tried to catch myself against the canvas and 
banged my hand into it instead. It wasn’t much noise but it was enough. I
 heard feet hurrying away and turned on my torch and went forward 
quickly.


Wur was lying face down and I could see from the marks on the 
ground that it had been his feet that had made the scuffling sound.


![deadground](/assets/img/afghanistan/14.png)



He was firm and unresponsive to the touch, as the dead are, and 
had no detectable pulse in his neck. A hand over his mouth and a long 
blade up under his ribs unless I was mistaken. I turned him over.


One of his open eyes had particles of dirt in it and that more 
than the blood and lack of pulse said that he was dead. I squatted over 
him, listening. I wished I’d brought my sidearm but there were no sounds
 of movement. I went through his pockets, collecting two phones, a few 
papers, some money in different currencies and a dangerous looking 
knife, and then left quietly and went back to my tent.


There was some writing on one of the papers. It looked like a 
list but I couldn’t read it. The phones had a few numbers stored in them
 but not under any names. There were some texts but, again, not in a 
language I could read.


I sat on the bed and stared into the darkness for a bit. Then I 
got out the old pipe and sniffed it again and stroked it for a bit. 
Life, apparently, is finite.


I took my socks off and beat them against the leg of the cot to 
get any dirt off them and then put them and my boots back on. I suited 
up, put my helmet on, made sure I had night vision, spares mags for my 
SA80 and went out.


Our two interpreters, suiting their ambiguous position, shared a
 tent between our tents and the ANAs. I tapped on the pole at the 
entrance and went in. Jadoon was in bed, his sleeping bag pulled up to 
his chin. I put a hand on his shoulder and shook him gently. He opened 
his eyes and looked at me.


“Hi, Jadoon. Are you awake?” I said.


“I am now,” he said.


“Sorry. Could you just read this for me?”


“Read what?”


“This.”


I pulled the piece of paper out of my pocket. He put a hand out 
from under the covers and took it. His eyes widened when he saw it and 
then he got control of his expression.


“Something interesting?” I said.


“Just a list of money owed I think. There are names of some of the ANA and figures.”


“Okay, thanks.”


I made to take it, but he kept it and said, “I’ll transcribe it for you in the morning.”


“Not to worry, I’m sure it’s not important.”


I took hold of his wrist in one hand and the paper in the other.


“Let go, Jadoon, or we’ll tear it,” I said.


“If you wish,” he said, and let go.


“Thanks. Sorry I woke you. See you in the morning.”


“Yes, sir,” he said.


As I walked across the parade ground towards the light gun my mind noticed that Jadoon’s boots hadn’t been under his cot.


Hesketh and Thompson were still on duty there.


“Hi, you two,” I said, sitting down next to them.


“Couldn’t sleep, sir?” Hesketh said.


“Something like that,” I said.


“You alright, sir?” Thompson said.


“Just thinking,” I said.


“Oh.”


They let me think for a bit and then Hesketh said, “Anything we can do, sir?”


“You must be off in a minute, Hesketh?” I said.


“Yes, sir. Five minutes now.”


“It’s very dark out there, isn’t it?”


“Very dark, sir.”


“I’ve got a feeling, Hesketh,” I said.


“Have you, sir?”


“Yes. I fancy a walk up to that place we were at today. Do you think C section would like to stretch their legs?”


“Yes, sir, I’m sure they would,” she said, sitting up and looking happy.


“But, sir…” Thompson said.


“Shut up, you idiot,” Hesketh said.


“Need to make sure all watch stations are covered, though,” I said.


“Leave it to me, sir,” she said.


“And I think we’ll go with a gimpy, Thompson,” I said.


“I was going to get one, sir.”


“We might be up there for a while.”


“Ratpacks all round, sir.”


“Okay. Rendezvous behind the stores tent at oh five hundred.”


“We’ll be there, sir.”


I gave them a smile, and in doing so, realised that it had been a long time since I’d smiled last.


It was a heavily loaded section that assembled under the Hescos 
behind the stores tent. I’d been kneeling there with my sig in my hand 
watching through the helmet mounted night vision system but no one had 
come to bother me.


![deadground](/assets/img/afghanistan/15.png)


They came silently, one by one, and knelt beside me, 
automatically taking up positions to observe. Like me they had night 
vision on and this obscured much of their faces but I was certain that 
they were happy to be up to something at last. It was a good feeling to 
have them around me once more.


“Right, you lot. I think I know the path but I could be wrong. 
Any loud noises and you go right back to bed and pretend this never 
happened. Got it?”


“Got it, sir.”


“If at all possible, all the NV kit needs to get back. Understand?”


“Materiel of tactical significance, sir,” Denton said.


“Yes. We’ll pause at the edge of dead ground for me to have a 
chat with Lieutenant Page and then we go on up. Hesketh knows the way so
 if you aren’t following me, follow her.”


“You could just borrow our tent, sir,” Deaks said.


“Permission to punch him, sir?” Hesketh said.


“Later, Hesketh. Now, we don’t know if we’re poking a hornets’ 
nest so we’ll have Thompson and Hesketh hanging back to lob in some 
forty mils if we make contact. Radio silence, everyone. Ready?”


Nod and thumbs up all round.


“Come on then.”


Denton gave me a boost up and I went over, keeping flat on the 
top so that I showed the minimum profile. I let myself down. No loud 
bangs. I had a look round and saw only grass and a pair of mouflon 
grazing it in the greenish intensified image. They put their heads up 
and looked at me. It was good to know that they were there; a cloven 
hoof will set off an IED as easily as a regulation army boot.


I leant my SA80 against the wall and waved Denton down, 
steadying him as he dropped. As each man came down he automatically took
 up watch with his weapon raised. Thompson passed down the general 
purpose machine gun to me and then came down and we were all there.


I could see where men had stood to fill cans from the protruding
 stub of plastic pipe and when I squatted down and concentrated I could 
follow the line in the grass which was the path. I led off without word 
and they followed at intervals.


The mouflon watched us go but didn’t yield any ground.


The path was on soil; an easy place to bury an IED, so I just 
had to trust that this wasn’t a trap. I made it to the river shore which
 was bedrock and gravel and waited for Denton to come up. He would be a 
way-marker until the next man came. I went on again, not towards the 
bridge and the village, but away from it. When I reached the spot that 
I’d identified earlier I waited again and then walked into the river. It
 was cold enough to make me catch my breath and deeper than I’d hoped. I
 forged on, my feet slipping on the smooth boulders. If I fell in it 
would be a real bugger.


We went on like this, spread out, dot and carry one, me leading 
and Hesketh in the middle, until we were on the shoulder of the opposite
 mountain and below the old Observation Post that we’d visited earlier 
in the day. No one shot at us and none of us stood on an IED. So far so 
good. I flicked on my comms system and spoke over the combat net.


“Lieutenant Ellice to Lieutenant Page. Come in Gerald, if you’re there.”


“What the fuck, Si? Why are you on the combat net? You’re in bed, aren’t you?” Gerald said. He seemed to be whispering.


“Not exactly. Are you by the IR?”


“Am as it happens. Why? Where are you?”


“You’re about to see a few people emerge from the dead ground 
and start ascending the hill, north-north-east. It’s me and C section. 
Perhaps you could refrain from killing us.”


“Si…”


“And I won’t be offended if you tell the old man. You’ve got a future to protect.”


“I’m afraid…”


“He’s standing behind you?” I said.


“Return to base, Ellice. That is an order,” Snowhall’s voice said.


“I believe it’s coming, sir. First light I expect,” I said.


“I’ve had the drones fly over again and there’s nothing moving. I repeat, nothing moving. Return to base.”


“Sorry, sir.”


I switched off.


It was Denton who disturbed the first rock. It bounded down the 
slope making an appalling noise. Except it probably wasn’t as bad as I 
thought; mouflon must do the same thing and I’ve never heard one. We 
stared up at the lip of piled stone above us. No one started shooting. 
No lights came on. No grenade tumbled down to us.


“On me,” I said, and went up fast, my rifle slung on my back.


Deaks and Hartigan were with me. I put my head up. Empty. I scrambled in and helped them up.


“Thank fuck for that,” I said.


“My grollies are frozen stiff, sir,” Deaks said. “That water was very fucking cold.”


“Mine too, Deaks,” I said, waving the others up. “But unlike yours, mine are in for a roasting when we get back.”


“Rosy fingered dawn,” I said.


The high cloud had softened the light, and the new day was breaking in pink.


“Did she, sir?” Hesketh said.


“Night’s candles are burnt out and jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops,” I said.


“You’re an unusual kind of rupert sometimes, sir,” Deaks said. “No offence intended.”


“None taken. We must have bloody noses and crack’d crowns and pass them current too. God’s me, my…”


“Are you alright, sir?” Denton said.


“Don’t mind him, corp,” Hesketh said. “He gets like this sometimes.”


“… horse, I think,” I said.


“It’s getting light, sir,” Denton said.


“Eyes sharp everyone,” I said.


“By the way, what are we doing here, sir?” Deaks said. “I don’t care like, but I was just wondering. Why today?”


“Do you know what I think?” I said.


“Not usually, sir,” Hartigan said.


“I think Wur was green slime.”


“Was, sir?”


“Yes, was. I found him behind the stores tent earlier. I think 
Jadoon and a couple of ANAs killed him and I think it means it’s all 
about to kick off.”


“Well fuck me, I’d never of guessed,” Hesketh said.


Below us in the base there was a sharp crack and the signals hut
 collapsed in on itself. Armed men streamed out of the mosque and ran to
 cross the river at the bridge and at a shallow place downstream of it. 
As they neared the barriers a heavy machine gun opened up from the house
 below us.


“You were right, sir,” Denton said.


“Comms on. Engage the enemy,” I said.


Thompson started working with the gimpy, trying to stop the tide
 of men surging over the barriers and Deaks was pinging away with his 
sharpshooter. Those of us with SA80s held our fire; out of effective 
range. Our turn would come later. The machine gun in the house was 
keeping up steady, disciplined fire at the watchtowers and there wasn’t 
much in the way of return fire coming back.


“RPGs,” I said.


“See them,” Thompson said.


The puffs of smoke indicating the launch of RPGs came from 
several points on the top of the barriers and there were detonations at 
the mortar positions and light gun. And then further detonations as 
ammunition went up.


“Shit.”


Men were running inside the base. Some towards the Command room 
and some towards the entrance. The ANAs streamed out of the entrance and
 took shelter behind the Hescos.


“Lieutenant Ellice calling zero, come in. Over.”


Nothing.


“Lieutenant Ellice to call-sign zero, are you reading me? Over.”


“Shit. Try to raise them on the VHF, Milton.”


“She’s getting hot, sir,” Thompson said.


“Keep going,” I said.


Hartigan was feeding belt after belt to the gimpy and men were 
falling from the barriers. Then they were running: running away from the
 base, back towards the shelter of the mosque.


“Rest it, Thompson,” I said. “You keep going, Deaks.”


“Sir.”


“No answer, sir,” Milton said.


“Bastards. I think they’ve taken out the light gun and the mortars too. I’m not sure about the javelins,” I said.


I was searching the base through my glasses. I could see bodies 
at the mortar emplacements and one man was crawling slowly towards the 
shelter of the command post. He was having to drag his legs behind him. 
The long finger of the light gun had dropped out of sight, which wasn’t a
 good sign. The canteen tent had smoke billowing out of it. At least 
everyone apart from the crawling man was into cover.


There were a number of bodies on the top of the PB’s wall. As I 
watched, someone inside the command post shot a man who was trying to 
crawl back over the wall and he slumped down and was still. I counted 
twenty or so dead in the area between the mosque and the base. Good 
shooting by Thompson.


An RPG curved out from near the mosque, cleared the Hesco wall and exploded in the parade ground, doing no harm.


Beside me Denton put a burst at the house below us and two men with AKs ran back into cover.


“She’s ready, sir,” Thompson said.


“Keep their heads down but conserve your rounds. I don’t suppose
 help is on the way. How many Terrys do we think we’re dealing with 
anyone?”


“A lot, sir,” Denton said. “Two hundred at least and look, sir.”


<p>He pointed to the village. I put the glasses on it. The light 
was strengthening every minute and what had just been dark spaces were 
becoming visible. There were more people there than I expected and they 
didn’t seem to be villagers. There was a group at the place where the 
partying had been. They were looking in our direction and there was 
something else…
![deadground](/assets/img/afghanistan/16.png)



</p>“Deaks.”


“On it, sir.”


He moved to the edge of the space facing the village and pushed his sharpshooter into the gap between two stones.


There was a flash of light, quickly subdued by pale smoke and then the crack of detonation.


“Incoming.”


I watched the heavy, blunt anti-tank missile rise and rise and then begin to fall, seemingly slow but then suddenly very fast.


It hit fifty yards short of us and more than that to the right. Splinters of rock flew up to us and the ground shook a bit.


Deak’s gun chattered and the men round the recoilless rifle in 
the village ran for cover. Not all of them though, three at least 
wouldn’t run again.


Below us the heavy machine gun in the house was pecking away at 
the base. Not wasting ammunition but keeping them bottled up. As I 
looked at it with my glasses a man was looking at me with his, peering 
carefully round the doorway. Down at the foot of the village men with 
AKs ran out and began to work up towards us. There was some small arms 
fire coming up to us, none of it well aimed.


“Right,” I said. “They can’t get into the base while we’re here 
so they’ll want to dislodge us as quickly as possible. We’re all going 
to die if we don’t get help so Milton, you get up high enough to bounce a
 signal over to Ghanzni and call in the uglies. Corporal Denton, you go 
with him, distract anyone who tries to stop him and take over if 
necessary?”


“Yes, sir.”


“Thompson and Hartigan, you see to it that no one crosses from the mosque to the base. Deaks, kill whoever you can see.”


“Yes, sir.”


“Hesketh, you and I will nip down the hill and winkle out that HMG.”


“Will we, sir?”


“Yes. Hopefully they’ll be so interested in us they won’t notice Denton and Milton going out the back. Ready, everyone?”


“Ready, sir.”


“Go.”


Thompson and Deaks did what they could to provide us with 
covering fire and Hesketh and I rolled out of the OP at the front and 
went down the initial bare rock slope, sliding and scrambling down at 
the risk of broken bones. A few bullets sang off the rock but we were 
still out of effective range of all the enemy except those in the house 
below us. When we got to cover in the broken ground below I looked back 
and caught a glimpse of Denton and Milton climbing like monkeys through 
the boulders above the OP and then the curve of the land hid them.


“Moving,” I said, and started working forward while Hesketh went
 firm and put suppressive fire at the house. I got to some kind of cover
 behind a rock and took my turn while she leapfrogged me. Two men ran 
from the house and I tried for them but they got into cover before I 
could catch up with them.


“Covering,” Hesketh said.


“Moving,” I said, and ran for it.


We went down the slope fast. There was more fire coming at us 
now and from different angles; they’d managed to get men out away from 
the house and into the cover of the folds of the slope and the piles of 
rocks. This meant that it was becoming impossible to keep their heads 
down while we moved. As we closed them we were coming more and more into
 effective range of their AKs. It was a game we were more likely to lose
 the longer it went on.


Above us Thompson and Hartigan were working the gimpy 
constantly. A flash of movement caught my eye and then there was a 
tremendous crump. I didn’t stop to see but ran again.


“Covering.”


No answer. I was in effective grenade range now so I used the 
underslung launcher on my SA80 to put one somewhere near the door of the
 house and then one in the rocks into which I’d seen men run.


“Hesketh. Come in, Hesketh.”


No response.


No time. I finished that mag, swopped in another and ran 
forward. Men came out of the house, raising their AKs. I went down into a
 firing position on my knees; they were in the SA80’s comfortable range 
now and they weren’t wearing body armour. Time slowed down. I narrowed 
my attention on the one to the right, bones, muscles, breathing coming 
into alignment. One, two.


His body bucked as both rounds went in. A bullet from his AK 
rose and fell towards me in the 4X sight even as I was tracking left. No
 time to think about that.


The next man, a white tunic, his AK stuttering, held badly, centre mass, there. One, two.


One in at least, the man falling sideways, his gun still firing. Moving left.


Something tugged at my head.


No time.


A man pulling out the mag, bending over it. Centre mass. One, two. Falling back. Got him.


No cover. No time. The sound of an AK from my right.


I ran. It’s not so easy to hit a moving target with an AK at 
more than a hundred meters. The angle of my run was bringing the doorway
 of the house into view. A man leant against the frame and took 
deliberate aim at me.


I threw myself down onto the stony ground, fumbling for another 
grenade. His bullets were passing over my head. I got it into the 
launcher, closed it and made myself adjust the sights.


He saw me aiming and ducked back in. The round-headed forty mill
 lump of high explosive followed him in and there was the sharp 
detonation. The heavy machine gun stopped firing.


I pulled a splinter of rock from my hand and sucked the wound. 
Behind me there were shots: an SA80. I looked back. Nothing to see. 
Down-slope two men got up from the slight cover of a depression and ran.
 They ran away, leaping and skidding like chamois, their guns held high 
to help them balance.


More shots from an SA80.


“Hesketh? Is that you, Hesketh?”


“Sir? Bloody hell, sir.”


![deadground](/assets/img/afghanistan/17.png)


I found her wedged between two rocks. There was blood running 
down her right leg and she wasn’t normally conscious. When I cut the 
cloth away it was bright red, arterial. I bound some gauze over it, 
checked her for other damage and put in one dose of morphine.


Another anti-tank missile passed over us and hit near the OP. 
The gimpy was still firing though. On the ground between us and the 
village men were moving. As I watched some made it over the skyline of 
the pass. Others were working closer, using what cover the terrain 
provided. There were a lot of them.


“I think we’d better get moving,” I said.


“Sir?”


“Let go of your weapon, Hesketh. This may hurt a bit.”


“Sir?”


I took it out of her hands, slipped out the magazine and tossed 
it away. Then I lifted her onto my shoulder. She groaned a bit and tried
 to help.


“Come on then. Let’s go see what we’ve done,” I said.


No reply.


I couldn’t manage better than a stumbling walk down to the house
 but no one bothered us. There was more smoke rising from the base. The 
air was full of the brittle sounds of small arms fire and still, the 
heavier burr of the gimpy above us. Thompson must surely be out of 
ammunition soon.


I put her against the wall and stepped into the house. The 
grenade had done most of its work low down, shattering the men’s legs. 
One was clearly dead. I dispatched another as he tried to lift his AK 
and gave the last one, one to the head to be sure. He looked familiar. 
The DShKa 12.7ml Soviet heavy machine gun at the window seemed to be 
undamaged.


Back outside I checked the men there and tapped one whose arm twitched.


“How’re you doing, Hesketh?”


“The sun’s nice, sir.”


“Think you could feed a belt?”


“Of course, sir.”


There was no window facing the village or the slope above, so I 
heaved the Dushka out and put it on the path beside the house. There 
were baskets stacked on the half-finished rug, the baskets the women had
 been carrying the day before. Each one held a neatly folded belt for 
the gun. I carried some outside and put them beside it, marvelling at 
the weight the women had carried without showing it.


“Do you think they’ll let you stay after this, sir?” Hesketh said.


“I’m not sure anyone’ll be staying after this. At this rate there may not even be an after. What do you think?”


“I think the uglies will come, sir.”


I forced open the top of the gun and had a look. A miss-fire was
 stuck in the breach, so I heaved on the cocking mechanism to get it 
out. That belt was nearly done so I disengaged it and threw it to one 
side.


“You look happy, sir.”


“You know what, Hesketh?”


“What, sir?”


“I am feeling better.”


“Me too, sir. Sort of.”


I started a new belt, slammed home the cover and heaved on the cocking handle again. It sounded and felt okay.


“You know you have to grieve, sir?”


“What’s that?”


“You have to grieve, sir.”


“Do I?”


“Yes. Anger won’t do.”


“Oh. I didn’t know that.”


“He may be dead but you can still ask him what to do, sir.”


“Yes, I know that.”


“I think you’re going to be okay, sir.”


“I didn’t think so, but you may be right.”


“I don’t think I’m going to be okay though, sir.”


“You’re pretty tough, Hesketh.”


“Not your fault, sir. Wouldn’t have missed it for the world.”


“Ready?”


“Always, sir.”


![deadground](/assets/img/afghanistan/18.png)


I picked her up as carefully as I could and put her beside the 
gun. She nearly passed out but she held on. The small arms fire was 
nearing the OP and several men with RPG tubes were moving up behind the 
leaders. They would be at almost point blank range soon.


“I’m here, sir,” she said, taking hold of the belt.


“Okay. Here goes nothing.”


I gripped the two wooden handles, swung the gun on its short 
tripod and looked through the sight. The lever was smooth under my 
finger. I braced and squeezed. The gun came alive, its heavy mechanism 
hammering metallically, the belt feeding smoothly and half inch jacketed
 rounds smashing into the rocks a quarter of a mile away. The heavy 
percussion of the exploding propellant deafening us and beating the gun 
back into my braced body. I adjusted my aim and started to work the gun.
 On the slope men were running like rabbits. A badly aimed RPG sailed 
over us and burst behind the house. Long distance AK fire was singing 
off the rocks all over the place.


Partway through the second belt Hesketh thumped me on my shoulder. I let go of the lever and looked at her.


“Uglies,” she said.


I looked up. The lumpy, disfigured fish shape of an Apache 
helicopter swam overhead and I realised that the air was full of the 
wump of its rotors.


“Do you think they know we’re here, sir?” Hesketh said.


“Oh shit. ISAF ground force to Apache, come in. Over… ISAF ground force to Apache, come in. Over…”


The valley was full of Apaches and it was starting to rain canon-fire and anti-personnel cluster munitions.


I scooped her up and ran for the house. Around us the air began to roar and sizzle.


![deadground](/assets/img/afghanistan/19.png)



She died in the under-croft where they’d stored the Dushka while
 everything around us turned to fire and darkness. I didn’t know until 
the Apaches stopped trying to kill us and ceased fire. I was holding her
 tight against me and I didn’t know that she’d gone.


When the ground stopped shaking and it was only dust and falling
 particles in the air I eased her away from me and said, “Hey, Hesketh. 
You were right, I do want to live.”


She settled back onto the dirt and my finger couldn’t find a pulse and I could feel no breath from her lips.


![deadground](/assets/img/afghanistan/20.png)


There was nothing to do so I pushed my way out of the rubble and
 waved at the nearest ugly. It came over to look, cannons swivelling 
towards me. I tapped my head and started to call it over the combat net.


Later, when we’d established communication and I’d been able to 
tell them the probable locations of the rest of C section I hunted in 
the rubble for the souvenir I wanted, found it, and then walked down to 
the base. Hesketh could stay where she lay for now.


Two Chinooks delivered reinforcements and started taking away 
the casualties. One Apache hovered overhead, keeping watch, and the 
others searched the hillsides.


Major Snowhall was sitting outside the remains of the ops room 
directing the evacuation of his men and refusing to let the medic attend
 to him yet. Men were running here and there in purposeful activity. The
 dead had already been laid out in a row under a tarp. There didn’t seem
 to be more than a handful.


“Si!” Gerald said, coming out of the building with an armful of comms kit.


“Hi, Ger. You made it then,” I said.


“Not a scratch. I can’t believe you’re still alive.”


“I seem to be,” I shrugged.


“Is that what I think it is?”


“This?” I held up the thing in my left hand.


“Fuck!”


“Present for the old man. Omar Wardak was here. He was directing operations from that house on the hillside.”


“That explains a lot.”


“Indicators? What indicators, exactly?” Lt. Col. Harrison of Intelligence said back at Ghanzni.


“There was the fact that the local man refused the offer of 
money tomorrow in preference for a few minor possessions at the time. 
Followed by all the noise during the night. We assumed that was to cover
 the movement of forces. And then the women moving things to the house.”


“So Major Snowhall decided to risk sending a section out undercover of darkness?”


“Yes, just in case. To an observation point which had already 
been reconnoitred and found not to be in use by the insurgents, yes, 
sir. The OC suspected that the absence of low level activity indicated 
the presence of a serious player like Wardak, sir.”


“Altogether a remarkable piece of foresight under the circumstances.”


“A very wise decision on his part, sir.”


“Yes indeed. A shame we didn’t know about Jadoon.”


“It’s a complex situation out here, sir.”


“Isn’t it.”


He didn’t believe me, but he couldn’t see what was wrong. It was a plausible story, and no one was contradicting it.


“May I ask what you’ve found out, sir?”


“Yes, under the circumstances you’re entitled to know.”


He filled in some gaps for me. I’d been right, Wur had been with
 them. He’d organised the smuggling out of the fuel in order to 
establish good relations with the locals. Perhaps he’d got wind of what 
was coming; we’d never know. It was Jadoon who had taken out the comms 
room and Jadoon wasn’t the Jadoon his papers had said he was, now that 
someone had bothered to check him out properly.


They found the cave at the back of the village where the 
munitions had been stockpiled and where the enemy had gathered and 
waited, each man with a thermal blanket to shield his heat signature 
from the eyes in the sky. Maulana Owir and many of the men and boys of 
the village had died too; fighting for a cause that wasn’t theirs; 
caught between us and the Taliban.


They found some of the bodies of the ANAs but most of them just 
vanished like smoke. Casualties amongst the Rifles had been relatively 
light considering; only six dead in the base.


And then of course there was C section.


It was Corporal Denton who got the radio up high enough; taking 
it from Milton’s body and harassed all the way up by lighter, fitter, 
more acclimatised Afghans. He died still sending; calling it in instead 
of defending himself.


Hartigan and Thompson took a direct hit from an RPG into the OP 
just before I opened up with the Dushka. If I’d been a little quicker 
they would have made it.


Deaks had moved out of cover to try and flank the Terrys 
attacking the OP and died in friendly fire from the Apaches cleaning up.


“All in all, it could have been a much bigger fuck up,” Harrison
 said. “There’ll be some brag rags handed out unless I’m much mistaken.”


“Posthumously,” I said.


“In the main, yes. Your OC wants to talk to you, by the way, Ellice.”


“Thank you, sir.”


“Good luck, Ellice. I expect I’ll be seeing you.”

I found Major Snowhall in the Rec Room and we adjourned to a 
quiet table with a bottle of whiskey and two glasses. He looked tired 
and defeated.


“You were right,” he said, pouring me some. “Without you on the high ground we would all have died.”


“So were you,” I said. “I got C section killed.”


“Yes, you did.”


I drank some whiskey and thought about the others. Denton, Thompson, Hartigan, Deaks, Milton and Hesketh. Mainly Hesketh.


“Why did you do it?” he said. “When you found Wur you should’ve brought it to me. We’d have posted sentries.”


“I didn’t think you’d listen. It wouldn’t have been enough anyway. You wouldn’t have taken the risk.”


“I might have. If I’d known.”


“Anyway, I didn’t care. I wanted to prove you wrong.”


“Well, you did that.”


“And I wanted to stay. I didn’t want to be separated from C 
section. I’ve been with them since the beginning. Did you know that?”


“No, I didn’t. That worked out for you then.”


I looked at him and he averted his eyes.


“Sorry, that was crass.”


“I’m not hiding from the fact I got them killed,” I said.


“Well you did. Was it worth it?”


“Truthfully?”


“You might as well.”


“Yes, I think it was.”


“You’re a sick bastard. You know that?”


I shrugged.


“I suppose I may be,” I said. “I believe it runs in the family.”


He looked at me as if I were another species; incomprehensible 
and offensive. I drank some of his scotch and looked at him. It struck 
me just how little I cared what he thought.


“You disobeyed a direct order,” he said. “I can have you court marshalled.”


“I saved your arse. Sir,” I said.


“I won’t let you do it again.”


We drank some more scotch. It wasn’t a friendly silence, but it was a truthful one.


“The Desmonds might have you,” he said.


“I don’t think I want the army in any form,” I said. “Write me up as temperamentally unsuited and let me go.”


“I haven’t the first idea what the fuck you are suited to.”


“So? Will you?”


“That easy, huh?”


“Unless you’ve got a better idea?”


“What will you do?”


“Go and visit their families.”


“And say sorry?”


“No, I’ll tell them how brave and loyal and wonderful they were.”


“Why?”


“Because they would appreciate it. And it’s true. And I owe them.”


He looked at me like I was a piece of shit again.


“And after that?” he said.


“After that I’ll go to sea and do my grieving. See if I can sail myself to the other side of it.”

When I walked out to the waiting chopper that would take me 
away, the hard light and the dust were the same as they’d been before, 
but I wasn’t quite the same. As the bird lifted off, I took Avus’s old 
pipe out of my pocket and sniffed it and stroked it one last time. Then I
 tossed it into the rotor-wash and it was instantly gone.
