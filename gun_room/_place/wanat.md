Combat Outpost Kahler1 was an outpost in northeast Afghanistan adjacent to the village of Wanat in Nuristan. It was populated by 48 U.S. soldiers, 24 Afghanistan National Army soldiers and three U.S. Marine Corps advisors. On July 13, 2008, the outpost was attacked by a significantly larger number of Taliban insurgent forces.  The insurgents used stealth, camouflage, communications discipline, and rapid movement over extremely rough mountainous terrain to establish positions close to the perimeter of the outpost.
The insurgents used coordinated rocket-propelled grenades, small arms, heavy machine gun fire, and mortar barrages to inflict heavy casualties. Nine U.S. soldiers were lost their lives and 27 U.S. and four ANA soldiers were wounded. The outpost was soon thereafter abandoned.
