One challenge that coalition forces faced in Afghanistan was the need to protect the local population from insurgent forces. To achieve this, security forces were placed in close proximity to the community they were there to protect. Patrol Base Azun, although fictional, is inspired by these small bases. 
The problem with positioning the security forces too far away, was they may have been unable to deter Taliban insurgents from threatening local civilians. However, placing small security units close to the local population also increased the risk to those units. This proximity balance has historically represented a challenge for commanders fighting insurgencies.
