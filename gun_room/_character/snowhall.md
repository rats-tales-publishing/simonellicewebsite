Professional soldier. Early fifties. Lower middle class. Home counties. Has reached the end of his chances of promotion. Likes to do things by the book. Is in over his head in a situation where those in command of him are requiring things of him which the situation on the ground doesn’t allow. Not an unjust or an unkind man, but not as strong as the situation requires. He finds Si’s confidence and carelessness annoying and the way the men look up to him, galling.

He struggles to make decisions solely on objectives, rather than on other’s feelings and wellbeing (unlike Si) and is trying to protect the lives of his soldiers when, from a purely military point of view, he needs to put them at risk.
