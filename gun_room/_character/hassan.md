Throughout Dead Ground, you can follow the story of Hassan through the illustrations. His is a story of loss of innocence and radicalisation. From a small boy brought up in the bosom of the village, playing among the poppy fields and streams, to a young Taliban soldier with an AK-47, barely eleven years old.
Hassan's story is all too common in the modern world, where extremists recruit easy cannon fodder in the form of child soldiers.
