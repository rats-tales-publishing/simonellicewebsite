Hesketh is  from a solid working class background. She’s secure, knows who she is, is unequivocally here in the world and getting on with it without angst. She’s tough, matter of fact and in many ways a natural soldier. She has good intelligence and good emotional intelligence (more than Si in many ways). She's an extravert and in any situation she finds it easy to focus on objectives rather than other’s feelings. 
She fancies Si a lot. And she admires him without any illusions about his faults. She finds his company exciting and responds to his courage and intelligence. Because she is an open book, the others are aware of how she feels about Si. Although she is the only woman in a company of men, she has amply proved herself and there is no tension between her and the rest. C section is a company of professionals and the job comes first.

If there is heroism in this story, you could say that it belongs most to Hesketh. Si’s motivations are selfish at best, but Hesketh is doing her duty, following Si into danger willingly out of love. When she says she wouldn’t have missed it for the world, she means it.
