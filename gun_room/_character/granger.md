The 2IC of patrol base Azun, under Major Snowhall. Dan is left with the day-to-day detail (and a good deal of the stress) of running the base. As a result, he is an insomniac and looks far older than he is. He is popular among the men as he tends to have their best interests at heart, and always advocates for them.

Granger is constantly making up for Snowhall's shortcomings. Where Snowhall acts too much from the heart, Dan is forced to be objective and carry the mental weight that Snowhall won't shoulder.
