The Himalayan Vulture is thought to be the largest bird found in the Himalayas. They are found predominantly on the Tibetan Plateau, the Pamirs and Kazakhstan, with their breeding ranges stretching from Afghanistan to Bhutan.  

They tend to soar on thermals at a height of 3,986ft. On the Tibetan Plateau they eat mostly dead domestic yak and can strip a carcass in two hours. They breed in January, nesting on inaccessible cliffs and ledges, sometimes as high as 13,927ft.
