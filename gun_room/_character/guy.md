 Ruthless, manipulative and utterly amoral, he is the scorpion who stung the frog. His nature undoes him. Presented with an opportunity for personal gain, or the destruction of others he will cheat, lie and kill without self restraint.

Although outwardly relaxed and apparently lazy, Guy has a driven quality. He sees others as objects for his use. He takes his reward in life from exercising his will over it and is in a subconscious war with the world of his class and peers which has rejected him. He comes from a military background, public school, Sandhurst, the Guards, but has a fatal flaw in his character which always leads him to defeat himself by doing something for a short term gain instead of a long term win.

Moving barely a step ahead of trouble from the Army to the darker peripheries of intelligence he finally fled the UK just ahead of the police with a good pile of his friends’ money. He washed up in the ancient smuggling port of Nador, Morocco where he set himself up as a small king in the teeth of those already there. He was building a reasonable trade in getting hash from the Rif mountains into Spain when he came across an opportunity to make some real money…

Never married, he has a daughter, the only person he’s ever had any respect for and perhaps, cared for: Sam.
