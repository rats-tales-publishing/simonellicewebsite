The Jast is the elected leader of the village.

The Nuristani village magistrates, or Jast, are responsible for organizing local festivals and dances and will serve as the official host for guests to the village. One reason that wealth is a prerequisite for leadership in Nuristan appears to be related to the fact that the Jast is frequently required to pay for local feasts and celebrations.

Although the role of the Jast is important, he would rarely exercise bold leadership. Consensus is very important among the Nuristanis, both within the ruling Urir and within the larger tribe. This is at least partially due to the fact that the Urir never had any independent governmental power to enforce its decisions.
